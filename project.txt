Hospital Management System — SRS (Software
Requirements Specification) & FSR (Feasibility
Study Report)
Document purpose
This document contains two parts for the proposed Hospital Management System (HMS) project:
1.
2.
SRS (Software Requirements Specification) — formal description of system requirements
(functional and non-functional), use cases, stakeholders, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
FSR (Feasibility Study Report) — evaluation of technical, operational, economic feasibility, schedule
estimate, risk analysis, and final recommendation.
This document is intended for project supervisors, developers, and stakeholders.
Part A — SRS (Software Requirements
Specification)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the system The Hospital Management System (HMS) will automate key hospital operations:
patient registration, appointment scheduling, clinical records, prescriptions, pharmacy inventory, billing,
lab/radiology orders, and administrative reporting. The system will be a web-based ASP.NET MVC
application using PostgreSQL as the backend.
1.2 Scope The HMS will support the following modules: - User management & role-based access - Patient
management - Appointment scheduling & calendar - Visit/encounter documentation - Prescription writing
and pharmacy integration - Billing & payments - Laboratory & radiology order/result management -
Inpatient admissions and bed/ward management - Reports & analytics (dashboards)
1.3 Definitions, acronyms & abbreviations - HMS — Hospital Management System - SRS — Software
Requirements Specification - FSR — Feasibility Study Report - ASP.NET MVC — web framework used for the
front-end/back-end - PG / PostgreSQL — chosen RDBMS

2. Overall description
2.1 Product perspective HMS is a standalone web application designed to replace manual record-keeping.
It exposes role-based web UI and RESTful endpoints for internal modules. It will integrate minimally with
third-party systems (optional): insurance provider APIs, SMS/email gateways for notifications.
2.2 User classes and characteristics - Admin — full access, config and reporting tasks. - Receptionist —
patient registration, appointment booking, check-in. - Doctor — view schedule, access patient history,
create visit notes, prescribe meds, order labs/imaging. - Nurse — view assigned patients, update vitals,
assist admissions. - Pharmacist — process prescriptions, manage stock. - Lab Technician — enter/approve
test results. - Accountant / Billing Staff — create/adjust bills, record payments, manage claims. - Patient
(Portal) — view own appointments, bills, prescriptions (optional requirement).
2.3 Operating environment - Server: Linux or Windows server hosting ASP.NET (Kestrel/IIS) and
PostgreSQL. - Client: modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) — responsive UI for desktops/tablets.
2.4 Design & implementation constraints - Use ASP.NET MVC (.NET 6 or later recommended). - Use
PostgreSQL as RDBMS. - Role-based access control required. - Data privacy — personal health data will be
stored securely (encryption at rest is recommended for sensitive fields).
2.5 Assumptions & dependencies - The hospital will provide domain knowledge and sample datasets for
testing. - Optional third-party services (SMS/email) may require API keys and extra configuration.
3. Functional requirements (high level)
Each requirement is given an ID for traceability.
FR-1: User Authentication & Authorization - FR-1.1: Users must authenticate via username/password. -
FR-1.2: Role-based permissions determine accessible UI and actions.
FR-2: Patient Management - FR-2.1: Create/update/delete patient profiles. - FR-2.2: Store demographics,
contact, emergency contacts, allergies, chronic conditions. - FR-2.3: View patient visit history and
documents.
FR-3: Appointments & Scheduling - FR-3.1: Book appointments for patients with chosen doctor/time slot. -
FR-3.2: Edit / cancel / reschedule appointments. - FR-3.3: Prevent double-booking; show availability calendar.
FR-4: Visits & Clinical Notes - FR-4.1: Convert an appointment to a visit/encounter and record vitals,
symptoms, diagnosis, procedures. - FR-4.2: Attach files (lab reports, images) to a visit.
FR-5: Prescriptions & Pharmacy - FR-5.1: Doctors create prescriptions with multiple items and dosage
instructions. - FR-5.2: Pharmacist views prescription queue and marks items dispensed. - FR-5.3: Medication
dispensing reduces inventory; low-stock alerts trigger when below threshold.
FR-6: Billing & Payments - FR-6.1: Generate bill for visit/services/medications. - FR-6.2: Record payments
(cash, card, insurance) against bills. - FR-6.3: Maintain unpaid/overdue status and printable invoices.
2
FR-7: Laboratory & Radiology Orders - FR-7.1: Doctors can place lab/radiology orders linked to a visit. -
FR-7.2: Lab technicians upload results; results become part of patient record.
FR-8: Admissions & Bed Management - FR-8.1: Admit and discharge patients, assign beds/wards. - FR-8.2:
Track bed occupancy and availability.
FR-9: Reporting & Dashboard - FR-9.1: Admin sees key metrics: daily appointments, revenue, stock alerts. -
FR-9.2: Generate reports: revenue by period, appointment trends, doctor workload.
FR-10: Notifications - FR-10.1: Send appointment reminders via SMS/email (configurable).
FR-11: Audit & Security - FR-11.1: Log critical actions (user, timestamp, action, target entity). - FR-11.2: Role-
based access enforced on server and UI.
4. Non-functional requirements
NFR-1: Performance - The system should respond to standard CRUD pages within 2 seconds under normal
load (<= 100 concurrent users).
NFR-2: Security - All authentication must use secure password storage (bcrypt/Argon2 or ASP.NET Identity).
- All sensitive data in transit must use TLS/HTTPS.
NFR-3: Availability - System uptime target: 99% during working hours (configurable for a semester
project). Backups daily.
NFR-4: Scalability - Application must be layered to allow scaling (separate app server and database server if
needed).
NFR-5: Maintainability - Code must follow MVC separation of concerns and be decently documented for
grading.
NFR-6: Usability - UI should be responsive and usable by non-technical staff. Provide simple forms and
validation.
NFR-7: Data Retention & Privacy - Patient medical records must be retained per institutional policy;
implement soft-delete for recoverability.
5. External interfaces
5.1 UI - Web UI for all roles (desktop-first design). Optional patient portal.
5.2 APIs - Internal REST endpoints for modules; optional external integration with SMS/email or insurance
APIs.
5.3 Database - PostgreSQL database server.

6. Use cases (brief)
•
•
•
•
•
UC-1: Receptionist registers a new patient and books appointment.
UC-2: Doctor views next patient, creates visit notes, prescribes medications, orders lab tests.
UC-3: Pharmacist dispenses medications and updates inventory.
UC-4: Billing staff finalizes the bill and records payment.
UC-5: Admin views monthly revenue report.
7. Acceptance criteria
•
•
•
All critical workflows (registration → appointment → visit → prescription → billing) must be
demonstrably functional.
Role-based access must prevent unauthorized actions (e.g., receptionist cannot modify
prescriptions).
The application must persist data in PostgreSQL and demonstrate at least three advanced DB
features: one view, one stored procedure, and one trigger (or equivalent advanced SQL operation).
Part B — FSR (Feasibility Study Report)
1. Executive summary
This FSR evaluates building the HMS as an ASP.NET MVC + PostgreSQL semester project. Conclusion: the
project is feasible technically and operationally within a semester if scope is controlled and development
follows an incremental roadmap.
2. Objectives
•
•
Build a functioning web-based HMS demonstrating database complexity, secure authentication, role-
based access, and real-world workflows.
Deliver usable UI, reporting, and evidence of database features (stored procedures/triggers/views).
3. Technical feasibility
Technology stack (recommended): - Backend & Web: ASP.NET MVC (.NET 6+), C# - Database: PostgreSQL -
Frontend: Bootstrap/Tailwind, jQuery or minimal JS frameworks - Optional: Charting library for reports
(client-side)
Skills required: knowledge of C#, ASP.NET MVC patterns, SQL/Postgres basics, HTML/CSS/JS, and Git for
version control.
Feasibility assessment: - The stack is well-supported and suitable for a semester project. - Hosting locally
or on a student cloud (e.g., Heroku/Render/Azure student credits) is possible.

4. Operational feasibility
End users: hospital staff and patients. For the semester project, demonstration can be done with synthetic
data and role-based demos.
Training & documentation: provide a short user manual and in-app help for major workflows. The project
should include brief admin instructions for seeding demo data.
Support: minimal — project will be maintained by the student team for the course.
5. Economic feasibility (cost estimate)
Costs (approx): - Development: student labor (time) - Hosting (optional for demo): small VM or free-tier
PaaS — estimated $0–$20/month using student credits/free tiers. - Domain/SSL: optional; SSL can be
provided by hosting platform.
Benefits: - Academic credit, demonstrable portfolio project, practical experience with web+DB.
Summary: low financial cost; high academic value.
6. Schedule & milestones (suggested 12-week semester plan)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Week 1–2: Requirements finalization, wireframes, ERD, tech setup.
Week 3–4: Authentication, user & role management, basic patient CRUD.
Week 5–6: Appointment scheduling, doctor schedules, calendar UI.
Week 7–8: Visit/encounter, prescriptions, pharmacy inventory (core clinical flow).
Week 9: Billing & payments integration, simple reports.
Week 10: Lab/Radiology orders and results; admissions/ward management (optional).
Week 11: Testing, bug fixes, polishing UI.
Week 12: Final demo, documentation, report submission.
7. Risk analysis & mitigation
•
Risk: Scope creep — team attempts too many modules.
Mitigation: Prioritize core workflows (registration→visit→prescription→billing) and mark extras as
stretch goals.
•
Risk: Lack of familiarity with ASP.NET MVC or Postgres.
Mitigation: Early learning week, use templates, sample tutorials, and scaffold features.
•
Risk: Data privacy concerns in demo.
Mitigation: Use synthetic data and avoid real patient data.
•
Risk: Integration with external SMS/insurance fails or is unavailable.
Mitigation: Implement these as optional features or mock services.

8. Recommendation
Proceed with the project. Keep an incremental plan, deliver the core clinical workflow first, and implement
additional modules (lab, admissions, insurance) as time permits.
